      When I took the personal thinking style quiz a couple months ago, I was mildly surprised, but not shocked, to learn that I was an abstract random thinker.  After all, I grew up in a household that stressed the importance of doing well in math and science, two disciplines that emphasize precision, logic, and pragmatism.  As a child, I found myself taking Kumon classes and memorizing the rules in textbooks to do well on tests.  I wouldn’t say I was someone that thought outside the box a whole lot.

      Things started changing for me when I started my professional career and realized a couple of things: 1) I wasn’t able to absorb material from books as well as in the past, so I needed to find a more effective way to learn; and 2) human interactions were my favorite part of work.  I made a conscious effort to foster positive relationships at work, picked the brains of my colleagues, and would attend work conferences any time the company would pay for them.  Further, I deviated from doing tasks in a sequential order to doing it in a more unstructured fashion.  I also started relying less on rules and formulas, and trusting my intuition and gut more.So it’s fair to say in my twenties, I morphed from being a concrete sequential guy to an abstract random thinker.

      Now aware of my thinking style, I am encouraged by how DBC’s curriculum will cater to it.  First, the DBC emphasis on pair programming suits me very well.  In the first 3 weeks, for example, the HTML/CSS content definitely gave me the most trouble.  After going through the entire Week 2 curriculum, I found myself still weak in the areas related to padding and positioning. But,   I then derived immense benefit from the guided pairing session covering this material, where I was able to pick the brains of two people that understood the material much better than I did.  If I can make a conscious effort to pair program consistently, it will help me greatly.  On a similar note, one of my local cohort buddies has invited a bunch of us to meet up in person several times over the holiday break to keep diving deeper into Ruby.  It will be participating in these human interactions that will determine my success at DBC.

      I am also very pleased by Dev Bootcamp’s promotion of the growth mindset.  The growth mindset merely states that an individual’s skill set is never permanent because the human brain has been shown to be malleable (known as neuroplasticity).  The more we exercise certain parts of the brain, those parts of the brain grow.  Which means that memory I used to rely on in  grade school, well I can redevelop that, perhaps by trying to memorize Sublime hotkeys and terminal commands.  I can also work on my other weak spots based on the opportunities the DBC curriculum provides me.  For example, the Gregorc model states that abstract random thinkers don’t accept criticism well, even if it’s positive.  I find this is true for me.  Dev Bootcamp’s framework for giving and receiving feedback will hopefully turn this weakness into a strength at the end of 19 weeks.
