      I’ve always operated under the assumption that on average, we are all created equally from an academic standpoint.  There may be small deviations above or below the mean in terms of ability, but generally speaking, we are all given the same baseline tools to succeed.  I believe that socio-economic status, cultural pressures to perform from family/friends, and mostly our own effort and drive account for the differences in academic performance.  Learning about the concept of stereotype threat further reinforced my long-held beliefs that we are all created equal.

      Stereotype threat, as coined by Dr. Claude Steele, is  the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype.  In Steele’s famous 1995 research, he tested the fallacy that African-Americans are not as intelligent as their European-American counterparts by having both sides take a verbal portion of the GRE.  Under the control condition, both sides took the test with the belief that it was a measure of intellectual ability.  Members of the experimental condition, however, were given the exact same test, but they were told that it was NOT a measure of intellectual ability but merely a way to study verbal problem solving skills.  The results are rather stunning:  African Americans in the control group did significantly worse (on average) than their white counterparts.  In the experimental group, however, African-Americans answered almost twice as many questions correctly, and there was no discernible difference in performance with that of the European-Americans.  This suggests that stereotype threat exists and acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy:  if one thinks they are going to perform worse, they often will.

      Being of Indian descent, I don’t know if I’ve ever felt stereotype threat in an academic setting.  If anything, people may have overestimated my ability in math and science, while underestimating my language and grammar skills.  But certainly, this was nothing I would categorize as a threat, merely something I was aware of growing up.  However, I can still relate to being stereotyped; generally speaking, every human being has to deal with negative stereotypes about themselves, whether it be based on ethnicity, gender, religious background, political affiliation, sexual orientation, etc.  Based on my own experiences and based on what I know now about stereotype threat, I would propose the following remedies for those affected by it:

        Given that it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, don't buy the negative hype that leads to stereotype threat.  Choose instead to focus on the successful “outliers” in your given field: believe that you are going to be that man/woman.  If you are a female in tech, strive to be the next Sandi Metz (author of the wonderful Objected-Oriented Design book we are all reading) or Sheryl Sandberg or Marissa Mayer; there’s no reason that can’t be you.  
        Buy into the idea of a growth mindset (versus a fixed mindset).  Until recently, common belief was that you are born with various characteristics of the brain (intelligence, creativity, ability to empathize with others, etc) and that there was nothing one can do to improve these.  Scores of recent studies, however, show that the brain is malleable and certain traits can be improved by exercising the brain.  So if you feel like your GRE scores may be lacking versus your peers, for example, this can easily be fixed by taking practice exams.   
        On an institutional level, I think increasing diversity is incredibly important.  One of the reasons that I think I haven’t felt stereotype threat is because I’ve always been fortunate enough to fall into a diverse academic or professional setting.  There is definitely strength in numbers, and when a workplace is set up so that no one feels like the odd person out, there is less of a tendency for someone to feel stereotype threat.
