      I want to talk a little today about blocks and their close relatives: Procs and Lambdas.  Now all 3 provide us with ways to group code in Ruby, but there are subtle differences between them which I want to address.  Let’s start with blocks.  
    </p>
    <p>
      A block in Ruby is just a bit of code that can be executed.  Blocks syntax commonly uses either a do…end construct or curly braces, {}.  They are commonly used in conjunction with iterators like #each to act on every element of an array or hash. See below: 
    </p>

    </p> 
    <p>
      The applications for the block are endless: we can use any number of methods on a block to extract the information we need.  Here’ s a snippet of code that will return the square root of every integer from 100 down to 4. 
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the block is not without its limitations.  Although most things in Ruby are objects, blocks are NOT.  This means that the block is ideal for ‘one-time use’ code.  For something more reusable, you will want to go with a procedure, or proc.  Procs can be thought of “saved objects” and can be named and called similar to methods.  Below is how you would set up a proc that returns the area of a triangle.

    </p> 
    <p>
      So procs are full-fledged objects that can be reused to execute code.  A lambda is pretty much the same thing, albeit with slightly different syntax.  See the example below for a lambda that doubles the input array. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So what’s the difference between lambdas and procs you ask?  There are two big distinctions: 
      1) A lambda checks the number of arguments passed to it, but the proc will not.  Whereas a lambda will throw an ArgumentError at you for the wrong number of arguments, the proc will ignore this oversight and pass a nil value.  
      2) When a lambda returns, it will pass control back to the calling method.  In contrast, when a proc returns, it does so immediately.
