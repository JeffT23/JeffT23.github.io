      When I started researching coding bootcamps a few months ago, quite a few of them sounded technically sound, like they would teach me how to become an excellent coder.  In addition, Dev Bootcamp seemed to also emphasize the personal aspects of being a web developer.  I was impressed by their efforts to teach the softer skills necessary to succeed in the industry: how to pair, how to give and receive constructive feedback, the stress they put on emotional intelligence.  So my initial impressions of DBC were very positive.

      Watching Shereef's fireside only reinforced my initial impression.  I loved the restaurant vs. kitchen analogy.  From the onset, I've always wanted this to be more than a business transaction where I simply learn a skillset, pay DBC, and then I am on my merry way.  I want this to be the transformational change that Shereef describes, the full-immersive experience.  I would love to make some lifetime friends in this program.  My desire is for us to have each others' backs, teach each other to code with the help of some really smart people, and hopefully have some nice job offers at the end of it.  During the process, if we learn yoga, how to be more mindful and self-aware, and how to be just all-around better people: well, that's not so bad either.
