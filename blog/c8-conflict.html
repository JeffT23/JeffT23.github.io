      My job before starting at DBC was in the Treasury of a commercial bank in New York City: I was a money market trader.  As far as trading gigs went, it was as stress-free as it got.  My job description was simple: monitor the cash position of the bank; when funds ran below a specified amount, go out and raise money for the bank so it can continue to lend/make investments.  Simple and stress-free, most of the time anyways.....

      I wouldn't characterize myself as someone with a short fuse, but there were a few times in which I completely lost my s**t.  Here are a couple of instances that I remember, names have been changed to protect the innocent (couldn't resist the old Dragnet reference):  
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> John Doe is a private banker that took in a large deposit from a client.  Treasury pays John's department a certain rate for these funds.  In theory, Mr. Doe will pay his client less than the rate he gets from Treasury, and he gets to earn the rest as a profit for his department.  Mr. Doe, however, agreed to pay a much higher rate to the client than the pre-determined rate, and now the bank is losing a fair amount of money on the transaction.  Mr. Doe insinuates that the rates he is paid are criminally low, and insists that Treasury should eat the entire loss and make him whole. </li>
      <li> The head of another department, Mrs. Mean, says that her group is completely swamped with work.  She suggests that since Treasury isn't nearly as busy or important as her group, Treasury will take over one of their job functions.In an effort to avoid conflict and be her genuinely nice self, the Head of Treasury complies.  The Money Market Desk within Treasury (aka me and one other guy) would not be tasked with this non-Treasury role going forward.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In both of these cases, I recall being ridiculously angry.  In scenario 1), I remember getting in a shouting match with John Doe.  In scenario 2), I remember (when my boss was out of the room) cursing in front of my coworkers and openly questioning how ridiculous it was for my boss to agree to this.  Regardless of whether I was provoked, I was out of line in both examples.  Anger might be an appropriate emotional response, but one should never let it overwhelm you and your thinking.

      The solution here would have been simple: step out of the situation, BREATHE, and revisit it when I had calmed down.  
      Make no mistake about it:  breathing exercises have the desired effect of calming you down.  Most meditation and mindfulness techniques tell you to focus on your breathing because it's a simple way to divert your attention, clear your mind, and put space between you and whatever is causing your emotional discomfort.  Heck, the good folks at Sesame Street even came out with a music video called "Belly Breathe", which teaches kids these same techniques.
