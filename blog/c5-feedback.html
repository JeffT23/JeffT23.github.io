      When I initially started the DBC program and did the research regarding thinking style (abstract random), I thought that the pairing experience would be most beneficial for my learning.  For the most part, it has been.  I've been able to pick the brains of some very smart people, and I have been able to pick up a myriad of things that I overlooked while reading the "The Well-Grounded Rubyist" or the Chris Pine book.  Pairing seems to bring out the best in people: most individuals, and our program is no different, love to teach and help others.  Peer programming also is an essential skill for the "real-world" that we hope to join in just a couple of short months, so I'm happy to be getting the exposure to it now.

      But all of that being said, pairing is hard, man!  I've always thought of myself as a decent workplace communicator, whether it be a one-on-one interaction or via e-mail.  However, pairing is a whole other animal.  For one thing, you are more or less interacting with a new person every time you pair.  This is different from talking to someome at work that you've already developed a rapport with.  There's a feeling out process that's prevalent and nerves may tend to kick in when you pair with someone for the first time.  You ask yourself: a) did I check-in enough? b) am I doing an appropriate job in the designated driver/navigator roles? c) am I conveying my ideas properly? d) am I slowing the other person down or am I going too fast?  The communication issues are then compounded by the fact that you are trying to talk in another language: Ruby vs. English.  I think the frustration is similar to my 8th grade Spanish class when we were only allowed to speak to each other in Spanish.  How can I accomplish this when I barely know any Spanish words?  Add to this the potential disruptions that arise from using Google Hangouts, and I would say effective communication has been an issue for me.  Thankfully, we have a few more weeks of Phase 0 practice to iron this out.

      One feeling in particular that I've got to deal with better is the frustration that arises when my pair and I get stuck mid-assignment.  I find that it's so much easier to think stuff through on my own instead of talking it through and "thinking on my feet".  It doesn't happen often, but it's something that I have to learn to power through.  I find that preparation helps: just doing the pre-requisite textbook material and briefly reading over the assignment first before starting the meeting helps me think so much more clearly during the pairing session.

      I've been impressed and grateful for the feedback I've received from my cohort buddies.  Almost all of the responses have been actionable, specific, and kind.  Admittedly, it was difficult at first to read some of the negative comments, but it's important to keep the big picture in mind: the feedback will make you a better programmer and a better person to pair with.  One of the pieces of feedback stuck with me: my pair thought I had a tendency to simultaneously drive and navigate when driving. It made this person feel like she wasn't being heard.  I was so annoyed at myself when I read this.  This was the last thing that I intended to do, but thinking back to the session, I knew she was spot on.  I've since tried to learn from that experience and slow myself down a bit when driving.
