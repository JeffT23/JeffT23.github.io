      When I started working on my personal website a couple months ago, I had zero experience with HTML & CSS.  Quite frankly, it showed: my spacing was all out of whack and the site just looked very basic with dull colors.  In addition, the DBC curriculum required us to blog a couple times each week.  I've always been a rather private person, and the thought of sharing my feelings on the web made me rather uncomfortable.  So initially, jefft23.github.io, was an unpleasant experience for me.

      Fast forward to the end of Phase 0, and I feel much better about things.  I just went back and re-read my blog posts, and I'm rather proud of the content.  It took me a while at first to write them, especially the cultural blog posts.  But now I find myself timeboxing 60-90 minutes, and I'm able to produce quality work in that time because I've gotten more comfortable with putting my thoughts on paper.

      Regrettably, I wasn't able to stick with the site maintenance program I set up in Week 2.  But this final week of Phase 0 afforded me plenty of time to revamp the site.  I turned to my wife and cousin for their advice, and their suggestions were in sync with what I was thinking.  Here are the changes I made based on their feedback:

    <ol>
      <li>Changing the color scheme: At first, I wanted to give my site a rather serious feel with darker colors. I wanted to give off the vibe of reading the newspaper when people were reading my blog posts.  Unfortunately, it just ended up looking depressing.  So the first thing I did was add a little color to make it a more playful and aesthetically pleasing.  The dark gray/maroon scheme was replaced with a light blue/light gray look. </li>
      <li> Changing the blog index page: Previously, this was just a listing of the blogs like so: "Week 1 Technical Blog", "Week 2 Cultural Blog" etc.  It was a very boring format.  The page has been broken into two subsets now, and the posts listed by actual title so that the reader more accurately knows what he's about to read before clicking. </li>
      <li> Adding a footer with links:  There was no footer previously; my e-mail address is now listed along with icon links to all of my social media sites.  
    </ol>
    <p>
      The site is still a work in progress that is far from being done.  There's so much more content I would like to add as time permits.  But considering I had no exposure to website building 2 months ago, I am both happy with the results so far and grateful for the skills I've acquired.
