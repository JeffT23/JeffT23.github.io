      This was week 1 of the JavaScript Phase 0 track, and after a month or so of using Ruby, I was a bit nervous about having to learn a new language so soon.  After a few days though, I'm happy to say that I'm picking up JavaScript relatively well.  It was very comforting for me to realize, that though there are certainly syntactical differences between the two, programming is programming at the end of the day.  If you can apply logic aptly to one language, you can most likely do so in another.  In this post, we'll go over looping and iterations.    
    </p>
    <p>
       As you may already know, Ruby offers several ways to loop and iterate.  Pasted below are two simple pieces of code.  The first prints out to the screen a simple triangle 10 rows in width, utilizing the .times iterator method.  The second expressionoutputs the names of the members of my cohort, one at a time using the .each iterator.

      Now let's take a look at the JavaScript code and output.

    <p>
      As you can see, the output is virtually identical: the only difference is that the console.log function doesn't output to the same line like the print command in Ruby is capable of.  And this is what I find so comforting.  Sure, the syntax has changed a little bit.  We now have to contend with those annoying semi-colons at the end of every line and those ugly brackets.  The iterator methods have been replaced by a while loop and for loop, respectively.  But big picture: though the language changes, the story remains the same.
