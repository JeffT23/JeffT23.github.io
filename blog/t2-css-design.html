      I want to talk real briefly about a couple of books I've been introduced to over the years, in an effort to solidify our understanding of when to use classes and when to use IDs (and hopefully make this topic a little more interesting).  The first book, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" by Dale Carnegie, was written about 80 years ago; to this day, it is probably one of the most popular sales/business books.  I'm a big fan of its practical, common sense advice that can be applied to all aspects of life, not just business.  For example, listed below is the highlights from just one portion of the book.  Most of it seems like common sense, but sometimes it doesn't click until one sees it on paper:

      Six Ways to Make People Like You
      1) Become genuinely interested in other people.
      2) Smile.
      3) Remember that a person's name is, to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language.
      4) Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
      5) Talk in terms of the other person's interest.
      6) Make the other person feel important â€“ and do it sincerely.

      I learned about the second book, "The Game" by Neil Strauss, from my bachelor friend Luigi (not his actual name) who one day decided that he wanted to get better at picking up the ladies.  The author was this thin, short, balding writer for Vanity Fair who claims to have landed the interest of Britney Spears and a host of other beautiful women by using a specific set of methods executed in a specific order (such as "peacocking" - wearing bright, ridiculous attire to draw a woman's attention & "negging"-offering up backhanded compliments to the one you are courting).  I read the book and was very skeptical.  However, the book did go on to have a successful VH1 spinoff.  And my friend Luigi?  He had gone from little luck getting dates to flooding my phone with pictures of the beautiful women he was meeting.

      In the world of HTML and CSS, classes are the Dale Carnegie book and IDs are more like "The Game."  Classes can be used many times within a given document (like using Carnegie's principles in life), while IDs can only be applied once (the principles in "The Game" only apply to picking people up; negging someone in the business world may or may not lead to a fist fight) The question to ask is this: "Is there any element that needs the same style, now or later?"  If the answer is yes, opt to use the class.  Also, bear in mind that you can use both! You can paint with broad strokes using classes for styling.  Since IDs carry a higher specificity than classes, one can then use them to adjust for a few nuances in the styling.
