      Remember in elementary school when teachers would say "There's no such thing as a stupid question"?  I suppose that statement is partially true.  While asking questions is an integral part of learning, asking good, well thought out questions is much more productive than asking any old question.  As it pertains to succeeding at DBC and in our future programming careers, it seems to me that this skillset could be further broken down into a) asking good questions online and b) asking good questions in person.   
    </p>
    <h4> <strong><u> Online Questions </u></strong></h4>
    <p>
      A couple of months into the DBC experience, I have heavily searched online forums such as Stack Overflow and Quora for answers to my coding dilemmas.  I believe the following things to be mandatory in formulating a good online question: 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do your homework:  In general, people love helping others.  They are willing to take a few moments out of their busy schedules to lend a hand IF you put in the initial effort.  This means that you should scour the net for an answer first.  You will probably find your question has already been posted and answered.  If not, feel free to post to a forum and several people will come to your aid.  I've seen instances where people get very annoyed about this online, and rightfully so:  it's  like your 1st grader asking you how to spell 50 words on each page of a book she's reading without sounding it out. </li>
      <li>Be specific:  The more specific you can be the better.  If you are having trouble with "for..in" constructs in JavaScript for example, maybe you can paste the snippet of code that you can't wrap your head around.  Don't just ask, "WhatBe mindful of spelling and grammar: this seems like a foregone conclusion, but I've seen so many posts that aren't proofread before posting.  It's hard for someone to post a response when they can't even understand the question. </li>
    </ol>
    <h4> <strong><u> In-Person Questions </u></strong></h4>
    <p>
      Asking the right questions is going to be critical when we get onsite next week.  The 3 bullet points above hold here as well:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Try to do all of the requireed readings/homework ahead of class; that way you won't be wasting anyone's time asking something that was covered in chapter 1 of the assignment.  </li>
      <li>Ask specific, but open-ended questions.  You don't want to ask questions that yield a yes or no answer, rather you want ones that will keep the dialogue going and lead to follow-up questions that suggest a better way to do it.  </li>
      <li>Try to frame your question in a clear, concise way that your colleagues can understand.  Speaking gibberish or bouncing all over the place is the in-person equivalent of bad proofreading: you can't get help unless you can communicate what you want.  </li>
      <li>One final thing to keep in mind: don't interrupt.  Interrupting may send the signal to your colleague that you don't respect their opinion or it may make him lose his train of thought.  Let him finish and then respond with any follow up questions.  </li>
    </ol>
