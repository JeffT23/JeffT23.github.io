      To recap what we learned last week, stereotype threat is essentiallly a self-fulfilling prophecy where people expect us to perform poorly based on negative stereotypes: we buy into these stereotypes and then end up performing poorly.  Logically speaking, if there was a way for us to tune out the negativity and just concentrate on the task at hand, stereotype threat would become a non-issue.  The concept of self-affirmation aims to do just that.  If we are to focus on the values that we hold most dear, we won't be concerned with what others are thinking.  With that in mind, I'll be focusing on the following three values while at DBC: family, growth, and integrity.

      During my first few years of college, I worked part-time at Macy's as a women's shoe salesman.  I can't tell you the number of Al Bundy jokes I got from friends, but I didn't mind the job.  Aside from the human interaction part that I really enjoyed, it also paid really well as far as retail jobs go.  And I needed every bit of that money to be able to treat my girlfriend to nice dates, dinners out, etc.  It gave me immense pride to be able to take care of her.   Fast forward a little over a decade, and I ended up marrying that girl from college and settling down with two kids.  Now, I take pride in being able to provide for my family.  When I'm at DBC, the curriculum is going to get tough and I'm sure I will get discouraged from time to time.  But realizing that I'm doing it just as much for them as for me will certainly motivate me to keep plowing ahead.

      The second value I'll be focusing on is personal growth.  I finished undergrad about 11 years ago, and in that time span, I've worked in 5 different roles, either by internal promotion or from switching companies.  So roughly every 2 years, I needed to do something new, or I would start getting bored and antsy.  Before I started DBC, I was in the same role for about 4 years, and I thought I was going to lose my mind.  The wonderful thing about programming is that it offers so much room for growth and learning that I don't think I'll get bored in the same way.  During those 90 hours/wk at DBC that we will have to slog through coursework, I'll try not to lose sight of the fact that this is the sort of growth I've been looking for since I started my professional career.

      The final value I want to highlight is integrity.  When I started working in a trading room at my last employer, a bunch of my colleagues told me the same thing: "it may seem like Wall Street is a huge place, but it's a smaller world than you think."  It was crucial, therefore, for me to protect my reputation by dealing with integrity and in good faith.  I took that advice to heart and have always tried to conduct myself accordingly.  I hope to take this same approach at DBC and onward into my future coding career.
