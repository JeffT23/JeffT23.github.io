      As we wrap up Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp, I realize that we've touched upon many skillsets.  In no particular order, we've learned a little emotional intelligence, how to use HTML/CSS to develop our own website, how to blog, how to program in Ruby, how to create objects in JavaScript, and even how to query in SQL.  One of the subjects we didn't touch upon however, is Ruby on Rails.  Since Rails will be an integral part of the onsite experience, I've put together a short primer on the topic.   
    </p>
    <h3> <strong> <em> <u> What Exactly is Ruby on Rails? </u> </em> </strong> </h3>
    <p>
      It's essentially a software library that builds on the Ruby programming language.  Rails is a package library (a Ruby Gem), that is installed using the operating system's command-line interface.
      It serves as a framework for building websites; it combines Ruby with elements of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a web application that runs on a web server. Because it runs on a web server, Rails is considered a server-side, or “back end,” web application development platform (as opposed to a web browser which is the “front end”).  
    </p>
    <p> Rails has two primary guiding principles.  They are as follows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Convention over Configuration (CoC): As opposed to other software systems that require extensive configuration files and settings, Rails relies on assumptions of default values without user intervention.  Thus, the developer would only need to specify unconventional aspects of the application.  This leads to less code and less repetition.    </li>
      <li> Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle: espouses the need to avoid duplicaton.  As processes repeat, a program becomes more harder to maintain and more difficult to debug.  Therefore, information should be stored in a single, unambiguous place, and that code should be reused as needed. </li>
    <h3> <strong> <em> <u> Rails: The Advantages </u> </em> </strong> </h3>  

    <ul>
      <li>Programming is easier and faster in Ruby than with competing frameworks.  This is due to the "opinionated" nature of the Ruby framework, which provides more productive techniques if you follow the "Rails Way".  There's also a vast library of open source code and plugins that further helps to facilitate matters. </li>
      <li> Rails has a strong testing framework in place.  
      <li> It's open-source, so there are no licensing costs to worry about.  
    </ul> 
  
    <h3> <strong> <em> <u> Rails: The Disadvantages </u> </em> </strong> </h3> 

    <ul>
      <li>  Performance isn't as fast as some competitors such as C or Java.  These speed and scalability concerns led Twitter to switch from Rails to Scala (powered by Java).   
      <li>  Though this is changing, Rails is not as popular at the moment.  Java and PHP are more widely used and have more developers.   
      <li>  Some web hosts are unable to use Rails because it uses up more resources than its competitors.  
    </ul>
