      As the proud parent of a bright 6-year old girl, I'd like to think that my daughter can be anything she wants to be when she grows up.  My wife and I try to do everything we can to support her interests and put her in a position to succeed.  She's always had a penchant for gadgets; I think she's been operating my iPhone and iPad more capably than me since she was 18 months old.  When she was 5, I heard about the Hour of Code program and promptly put her through the 60-minute introduction to programming.  She enjoyed these basic concepts and then started on an app I bought her called Lightbot, where she learned coding concepts (procedures, overloading, loops, conditionals) by programming a robot to perform certain tasks for her.  Next up, I am considering purchasing her a Kano computer kit (link here: http://www.kano.me/kit), a build and code yourself system designed for kids.  So as far as fostering her love of tech, I think we've got her covered.

     One thing frightens me about the technology industry though, as it pertains to my daughter.  Of all the smart, ambitious females in my circle of family and friends, I can probably count on one hand the number that work in tech;  most have chosen to go into medicine, teaching, psychology, nursing, and finance.  The statistics show that I'm probably not alone.  In my research, I found that men outnumber females 7 to 3 in tech. A 2012 study shows that only 18 percent of computer science majors are female versus 37 percent in 1985.  Another study shows that once women starting out in the tech field get their MBAs, 53 percent actually leave the industry altogether (versus only 31 percent for men).  The first figure shows me that there is a definite gender gap in the industry.  The second suggests to me that there is a "pipeline" issue, where our best and brightest females aren't even considering computer science as an option.  The final statistic suggests to me that there is a "leaky pipeline," perhaps a cultural reason why women are leaving tech once they are here.

      Let's address the cultural issue first.  Now, seeing as how I'm a male with a trading/finance background, I feel as though I'm unqualified to comment on the culture that females have had to endure in tech.  However, I will cite a Fortune magazine article (title: "Why Women Leave Tech: It's the culture, not because the math is hard") surveying 716 women and their reasons for leaving the industry.  A couple of numbers really stuck out at me.  First, 85 folks cited maternity leave policy as a reason for the industry, more than 10 percent!  The easy solution is to bring the industry in line with the standard in most industries and large companies:  6 weeks paid leave, and more unpaid if needed.  Further, most workplaces have started to designate private areas where Moms can pump (breast milk), without inconvenience or awkwardness; the tech industry needs to get on board with this as well.  These are the easy fixes.  Things like discrimination based on gender, race, and sexual orientation will be harder to solve and are a legitimate cause for concern.  Which leads me to the second set of numbers that concerns me: of the 716 women that quit a tech job, 625 say they have no plans on returning to tech, and a whopping 465 are unemployed.  The culture was so poor in their eyes that these highly trained and educated women would rather not work than return to tech: very concerning.

      I'm a little bit more optimistic when it comes to fixing the pipeline issue, partly because I see that we are headed in the right direction already.  To me, the first step is education at an early age.  I think our public schools should expose computer science and coding principles to our children in elementary school.  Further, we should explain to them exactly what a computer science career may entail, make it as easy to understand for them as a career in law enforcement or medicine.  Second, I think we need to do more to attract girls to technology at an entertainment level: make the right toys for girls and I can assure you there will be a market for it.  For example, engineering is in a similar boat in regards to attracting females.  A company called GoldiBlox came out with a line of toys that promote engineering principles: they are selling like hotcakes and have won numerous Toy of the Year awards.  Wouldn't it be neat if the tech industry could accomplish the same thing?  Nothing would move girls to tech faster than a Disney storyline that revolved around a computer programming princess.

      I'm not sure what the future holds for my daughter and her professional career; she may change her mind on this several times over the next decade or two.    When my baby sister was five, her biggest aspiration was to be a cashier at McDonald's; she is now about to start medical school.  Right now, my little one wants to be a teacher, which is absolutely awesome.  But, if she changes her mind and wants to go into the tech sector, it would be nice for me to know that there is a better groundwork in place than now for her to be successful.
