    <main>
      <p>Pair programming is a development technique where two programmers collaborate
      on a single coding problem.  It consists of a driver, who types the code, and 
      a navigator who guides the driver along in the right direction.The 3 main 
      combinations of pair programming would be expert-expert, expert-novice, and novice.  
      </p>  
      <p>Why is pair programming important to DBC? DBC wants to prepare us for "the real world" and this is
      a skill we will need in software development. Further, it teaches empathy for fellow programmers and 
      enhances emotional intelligence. It's also a great learning tool as the programmers can learn from each other during the course of the project. Finally, mistakes are minimized with two
      sets of eyes on the program. Research shows that some other benefits are:
